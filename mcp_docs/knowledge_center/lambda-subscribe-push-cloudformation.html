topic in my AWS CloudFormation stack.</p></div><div class="custom-md-style" data-test="kcArticle-body"><h2>Short description</h2>
<p>If you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-eventsourcemapping.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping docs.aws.amazon">AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping</a> resource to subscribe your Lambda function, then you might receive the following error: &quot;Unrecognized event source, must be kinesis or dynamodb stream.&quot;</p>
<p>This resource is designed for pull-based event sources, such as Amazon DynamoDB event streams and Amazon Kinesis. When you use push-based event sources, such as Amazon S3 Event Notifications or Amazon SNS messages, the event source invokes the Lambda function. For a push event source to invoke a Lambda function, the function&#x27;s resource policy must authorize a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html#listing-of-services-and-links-to-more-information" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="service that can invoke Lambda functions docs.aws.amazon">service that can invoke Lambda functions</a>.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>In your CloudFormation template, add a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="resource-based policy docs.aws.amazon">resource-based policy</a> with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-permission.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="AWS::Lambda::Permission docs.aws.amazon">AWS::Lambda::Permission</a> resource.</p>
<p>For example, the following resource-based policy allows an Amazon SNS topic to invoke a Lambda function:</p>
<pre><pre node="[object Object]" style="background:#e4e5e5;color:hsl(230, 8%, 24%);font-family:&quot;Fira Code&quot;, &quot;Fira Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;DejaVu Sans Mono&quot;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1px;margin:0;overflow:auto;border-radius:0.3em"><code style="white-space:pre;background:#e4e5e5">&quot;LambdaResourcePolicy&quot;: {  &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;AWS::Lambda::Permission&quot;,

    &quot;SourceArn&quot; : { &quot;Ref&quot; : &quot;MySNSTopic&quot; }
  }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>For an Amazon SNS topic event source, you must define a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-sns-policy.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="topic policy docs.aws.amazon">topic policy</a> that has the required permissions.</p>
<p>For an Amazon S3 event source, you must have a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-notificationconfig.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="notification configuration docs.aws.amazon">notification configuration</a> statement that subscribes the Lambda function to the Amazon S3 bucket.

<p>In this example, the S3 bucket and notification configuration are created at the same time. The example avoids a circular dependency through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Fn::GetAtt docs.aws.amazon">Fn::GetAtt</a> intrinsic function and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="DependsOn docs.aws.amazon">DependsOn</a> attribute to create the resources.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the DependsOn attribute isn&#x27;t specified, CloudFormation creates the S3 bucket and Lambda permission resources at the same time.</p>
<p>The resources are created in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role</li>
<li>Lambda function</li>
<li>Lambda permission</li>
<li>S3 bucket</li>
</ul>

","shortDescription":"Resolve error when subscribing Lambda functions to push-based event sources in CloudFormation","body":"Short description\n-----------------\n\nIf you use the [AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-eventsourcemapping.html) resource to subscribe your Lambda function, then you might receive the following error: \"Unrecognized event source, must be kinesis or dynamodb stream.\"\n\nThis resource is designed for pull-based event sources, such as Amazon DynamoDB event streams and Amazon Kinesis. When you use push-based event sources, such as Amazon S3 Event Notifications or Amazon SNS messages, the event source invokes the Lambda function. For a push event source to invoke a Lambda function, the function's resource policy must authorize a [service that can invoke Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html#listing-of-services-and-links-to-more-information).\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nIn your CloudFormation template, add a [resource-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html) with the [AWS::Lambda::Permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-permission.html) resource.\n\nFor example, the following resource-based policy allows an Amazon SNS topic to invoke a Lambda function:\n\n```plaintext\n\"LambdaResourcePolicy\": {  \"Type\": \"AWS::Lambda::Permission\",\n  \"Properties\": {\n    \"FunctionName\" : { \"Ref\" : \"MyFunction\" },\n    \"Principal\": \"sns.amazonaws.com\",\n    \"Action\": \"lambda:InvokeFunction\",\n    \"SourceArn\" : { \"Ref\" : \"MySNSTopic\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor an Amazon SNS topic event source, you must define a [topic policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-sns-policy.html) that has the required permissions.\n\nFor an Amazon S3 event source, you must have a [notification configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-notificationconfig.html) statement that subscribes the Lambda function to the Amazon S3 bucket. For example:\n\n```plaintext\n{  \"AWSTemplateFormatVersion\": \"2010-09-09\",\n  \"Parameters\": {\n    \"BucketPrefix\": {\n      \"Type\": \"String\",\n      \"Default\": \"test-bucket-name\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Resources\": {\n    \"EncryptionServiceBucket\": {\n      \"DependsOn\": \"LambdaInvokePermission\",\n      \"Type\": \"AWS::S3::Bucket\",\n      \"Properties\": {\n        \"BucketName\": {\n          \"Fn::Sub\": \"${BucketPrefix}-encryption-service\"\n        },\n        \"NotificationConfiguration\": {\n          \"LambdaConfigurations\": [\n            {\n              \"Function\": {\n                \"Fn::GetAtt\": [\n                  \"AppendItemToListFunction\",\n                  \"Arn\"\n                ]\n              },\n              \"Event\": \"s3:ObjectCreated:*\",\n              \"Filter\": {\n                \"S3Key\": {\n                  \"Rules\": [\n                    {\n                      \"Name\": \"suffix\",\n                      \"Value\": \"zip\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"LambdaInvokePermission\": {\n      \"Type\": \"AWS::Lambda::Permission\",\n      \"Properties\": {\n        \"FunctionName\": {\n          \"Fn::GetAtt\": [\n            \"AppendItemToListFunction\",\n            \"Arn\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"Action\": \"lambda:InvokeFunction\",\n        \"Principal\": \"s3.amazonaws.com\",\n        \"SourceAccount\": {\n          \"Ref\": \"AWS::AccountId\"\n        },\n        \"SourceArn\": {\n          \"Fn::Sub\": \"arn:aws:s3:::${BucketPrefix}-encryption-service\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"AppendItemToListFunction\": {\n      \"Type\": \"AWS::Lambda::Function\",\n      \"Properties\": {\n        \"Handler\": \"index.handler\",\n        \"Role\": {\n          \"Fn::GetAtt\": [\n            \"LambdaExecutionRole\",\n            \"Arn\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"Code\": {\n          \"ZipFile\": {\n            \"Fn::Join\": [\n              \"\",\n              [\n                \"exports.handler = function(event, context) {\",\n                \"console.log('Received event: ', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));\",\n                \"};\"\n              ]\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n        \"Runtime\": \"nodejs20.x\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"LambdaExecutionRole\": {\n      \"Type\": \"AWS::IAM::Role\",\n      \"Properties\": {\n        \"AssumeRolePolicyDocument\": {\n          \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n          \"Statement\": [\n            {\n              \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n              \"Principal\": {\n                \"Service\": [\n                  \"lambda.amazonaws.com\"\n                ]\n              },\n              \"Action\": [\n                \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        \"Path\": \"/\",\n        \"Policies\": [\n          {\n            \"PolicyName\": \"root\",\n            \"PolicyDocument\": {\n              \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n              \"Statement\": [\n                {\n                  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                  \"Action\": [\n                    \"logs:*\"\n                  ],\n                  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/path/\u003clog-group-name\u003e:log-stream:\u003clog-stream-name\u003e\"\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the S3 bucket and notification configuration are created at the same time. The example avoids a circular dependency through the [Fn::GetAtt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html) intrinsic function and the
